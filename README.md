# Text-to-Image Generation with Ollama and Stable Diffusion

Welcome to the **Text-to-Image Generation** app! This app combines the power of **Ollama**'s text generation (via the Llama model) and **Stable Diffusion**'s text-to-image capabilities to generate stunning visuals from simple text prompts.

Whether you're a creative professional, a hobbyist, or just curious, this app lets you experiment with text-to-image generation in a fun and easy-to-use Streamlit interface.

##  Features
- **Text Prompt Generation**: Enter a simple text, and the Llama model will refine it into a more creative and detailed prompt.
- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion takes the refined prompt and generates a unique image based on it.

##  Requirements
Before running the app, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Python** 3.7 or higher
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **diffusers**: To run the Stable Diffusion model.
- **torch**: Required for GPU acceleration (optional but recommended).
